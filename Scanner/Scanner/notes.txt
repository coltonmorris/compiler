in start node?
use forward declaration if programNode isn't made yet?
public:
startNode(ProgramNode *pn);
private:
ProgramNode *mpn; (in the implementation, this class member equals pn)

for Match()
 


if (<exp>) <statement>


int x;
int sum;
sum = 35 +400;
x = sum == 435;
//x is 1, because true. 0 is false
//cout sum == 435 would output 1

peek next token call get noxt token inside. if you hit end of file, clear it.

peeknext
int lineNumber = mLinenumber;
streamoff where = mFin.tellg();
TokenClass result = GetNextToken()
if(!mFin) { //mFin.eof()
	mFin.clear();
}
mFin.seekg(where); //put the file position where
mLineNumber = lineNumber; //put the line numer
return result

block node is the 4th kind of statement to look for (in statement, look for lcurly then call the block method)
